# FCEN-algorithms
Some algorithm and problem implementations. Some of them part of projects at the Universidad de Buenos Aires - Computer Science degree.

## Lord of the Knights
University Project. The problem is solved using backtracking. The idea of the exercise is to show the high cost of 
the backtracking technique and how it could be improved by pruning the recursion tree.
The project includes implementation in Java and experimentation to verify complexity and execution time.
